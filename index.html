      <span class="So, random moment of the day — I was just sitting here, thinking about how wild it is that out of 8 billion people, I somehow landed you. Like, what did I do right? Did I save a village in a past life or something?

You’re seriously the best part of every day. Whether we’re talking for hours or just existing in the same space doing nothing, it’s always better when you’re around. Your laugh? Instant serotonin. Your voice? My favorite sound. Your texts? My screen time problem.

I don’t always have the fanciest words — I’m not a poet, I’m just a guy who somehow got lucky enough to call you mine. But I promise, no matter how ordinary the day feels, my love for you is anything but ordinary. You’ve got me in ways no one else ever has.

Just wanted you to know — I love you. For real.">Open</span>
